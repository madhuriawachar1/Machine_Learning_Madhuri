```small, weighted summaries of large data sets such that solutions found on the summary itself are provably compet- itive with solutions found on the full data set.```


#computing cost

``` Let X be a weighted data set where x ∈ X is a data point and μX (x) denotes its corresponding (non-negative) weight. Given the data set X and a space of possible solutions Q, one aims to find a solution Q ∈ Q that minimizes a cost function, i.e., cost(X,Q). In this work, we focus on cost functions cost(X,Q) that are additively decomposable into non- negative functions fQ(x), i.e.,```


#$$cost(X , Q) =  μX(x)fQ(x)$$
